Parallel (single write multiple read) HDF5 for Python
=====================================================

v0.3

h5pySWMR is a drop-in replacement for the [h5py](http://www.h5py.org) library.
h5pySWMR synchronizes read and write access to HDF5 files. It allows parallel
reading, but writing is serialized.
With h5pySWMR, you can read and write HDF5 files from parallel
processes (with threads, there are some limitations, see below) without having
to fear data corruption. Note that, with h5py, reading and writing from/to a
file can result in data corruption.

Example:

```python
# replaces 'from h5py import File'
from h5pyswmr import File

f = File('test.h5', 'w')
# create a dataset containing a 500x700 random array
f.create_dataset(name='/mygroup/mydataset', data=np.random.random((500, 700)))
# read data back into memory
data = f['/mygroup/mydataset'][:]
# no need to explicitely close the file (files are opened/closed when accessed)
```



FAQ
---

#### When should I use h5pySWMR?

When you want to read and write hdf5 files at the same time, i.e.,
from parallel processes.

#### Is h5pySWMR production ready?

Yes. Read section 'Limitations', though.

#### Is h5pySWMR Python 3 compatible?

Of course it is.

#### Does h5pySWMR require the MPI version of HDF5?

No.

#### Is h5pySWMR as fast as h5py?

Almost. There is a small overhead due to synchronization and because files
must be opened/closed for every operation. This overhead is neglible,
especially if you read/write large amounts of data.

#### What is HDF5 and what is h5py?

HDF5 (Hierarchical Data Format 5) is a binary file format designed to store
large amounts of numerical raster data, i.e., arrays. It also allows to
store data in so-called groups (hence the name "Hierarchical").
h5py is a great library that provides Pythonic bindings to the HDF5 library.

#### How does h5pySWMR work?

Even though HDF5 (and h5py) does not allow parallel reading **and** writing,
parallel reading is possible (with the restriction that files are opened
only **after** processes are forked). This allows us — using appropriate
synchronization techniques — to provide parallel reading and **serialized**
writing, i.e., processes (reading or writing) are forced to wait while a file
is being written to. This is sometimes called "single write multiple read"
(SWMR). h5pySWMR implements a standard solution to the readers-writers problem,
giving preference to writers. Check the 1971
[paper](http://cs.nyu.edu/~lerner/spring10/MCP-S10-Read04-ReadersWriters.pdf)
by Courtois, Heymans, and Parnas if you're interested.
A [redis](http://www.redis.io)-server is used to implement inter-process locks
and counters.

#### Why is it not on pypi?

It will be, soon...

#### I found a bug, what should I do?

Please open an issue on github.


Limitations
-----------

* True parallel reading can only be achieved with parallel processes. Thread
  concurrency is not supported. This is a limitation of h5py, which currently
  does not release the global interpreter lock (GIL) for I/O operations.
* After a crash (or if the process is killed by sending a SIGKILL signal), the
  redis-based synchronization algorithm may end up in an inconsistent state.
  This can result in deadlocks or data corruption.
  Proper process termination (SIGTERM or pressing Ctrl+C) is fine, though.
* Be careful when using h5pySWMR in a multithreaded environment. Signal
  handling does not work well with threads. Therefore, it is very likely that
  you end up with pending locks when you terminate threads during I/O
  operations.


Differences between h5py and h5pySWMR
-------------------------------------

In general, you could simply replace `import h5py` with `import h5pyswmr as h5py`
and everything should work as expected. There are a few differences and
limitations, though:

* TODO


Installation
------------

Using pip (globally or in a virtualenv):
```
$ pip install git+https://github.com/meteotest/h5pySWMR.git
```

Manually:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/meteotest/h5pySWMR.git
$ python setup.py install
```


Running tests
-------------

To make sure everything works as expected, run the following:

```python
import h5pyswmr
h5pyswmr.test()
```

Prerequisites
-------------

It probably works with any recent version of Python, h5py, and redis. But I've
only tested it with Python 2.7/3.4 and the following library versions:

* h5py 2.3.1 to 2.5
* redis 2.10.3

See http://www.h5py.org for h5py requirements (basically NumPy, Cython and the HDF5 C-library).

h5pyswmr also requires a running redis server (see below).


Configuration of the redis server
---------------------------------

Note that h5pyswmr is expecting a running redis server on
`localhost:6379` (on Debian based systems, `apt-get install redis-server` is all you need to do).
These settings are hard-coded but can be modified at run time
(a more elegant solution will be provided in future versions):

```python
import redis
from h5pyswmr import locking

# overwrite redis connection object
locking.redis_conn = redis.StrictRedis(host='localhost', port=6666, db=0,
                                       decode_responses=True)
```

For performance reasons (after all, hdf5 is all about performance),
you may want to keep the redis server on the same machine.
