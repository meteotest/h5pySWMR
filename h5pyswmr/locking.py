"""
Cross-process readers/writer synchronization.
The algorithm implemented is "Problem 2" in the following paper:
http://cs.nyu.edu/~lerner/spring10/MCP-S10-Read04-ReadersWriters.pdf
Note that the proposed solution works for threads accessing a shared resource.
To get a working solution for process-based concurrency, one has to deal
with (unexpected) process termination, which makes our solution slightly
more involved.

Lock/semaphore implementation based on redis server.
Using redis allows locks to be shared among processes, even if processes are
not forked from a common parent process.
Redis locks inspired by:
http://www.dr-josiah.com/2012/01/creating-lock-with-redis.html
http://redis.io/topics/distlock

Note that — in addition to a lock name — every acquire/release operation
requires an identifier. This guarantees that a lock can only be released by
the client (process/thread) that acquired it. Unless, of course,
the identifier is known to other clients as well (which is also a reasonable
use case).
For example a client may acquire a lock and be busy with an expensive
operation that takes longer than the lock's timeout. This causes the lock
to be automatically released. After that happened, another client may
acquire the same lock (with a different identifier). The different
identifier now prohibits the first client from releasing the lock, which
is good because the second client may be performing critical operations.
This reduces (but does not eliminate) potential damage. Clearly,
programmers should make sure that clients do not exceed lock timeouts.
